				<strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong>

			<div class='innerText'>
				When it comes to the collection of personal information from
				children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online
				Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal

				<strong>Fair Information Practices</strong>
			</div>
			<br />
			<div class='innerText'>
				The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of
				privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have
				played a significant role in the development of data protection laws
				around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice
				Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply
				with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.<br>
				<br>
			</div>
			<div class='innerText'>
				<strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information
					Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a

			<div class='innerText'>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> Within 7
				business days
			</div>
			<div class='innerText'>
				<br>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which
				requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue
				enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail
				to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that
				individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also
				that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to
				investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
